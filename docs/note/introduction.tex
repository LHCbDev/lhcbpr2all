\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}

This is the template for typesetting LHCb notes and journal papers.
It should be used for any document in LHCb~\cite{Alves:2008zz} that is to be
publicly available. The format should be used for uploading to
preprint servers and only afterwards should specific typesetting
required for journals or conference proceedings be applied. The main
\LaTeX\ file contains several options as described in the \LaTeX\ comment
lines.

It is expected that these guidelines are implemented for papers already
before they go into the first collaboration wide review. 

This template also contains the rules for how publications and
conference reports should be written. Through the symbols defined in
\texttt{lhcb-symbols-def.tex} it should be easy to follow the majority
of requirements set out here.

The front page should be adjusted according to what is
written. Default versions are available for papers, conference reports
and analysis notes. Just comment out what you require in the
\texttt{main.tex} file.
